Network segmentation and Acl application using Packet Tracer.

## Case Study Overview 
#### Catnork Technologies Ltd is a rapidly expanding technology company that has recentiy relocated to a new office space. 
#### As part of the IT department's mandate, their primary task is to design and implement a secure internal network that suports both productivity and protects internal network that support both productivity and protects internal services.
#### The company's infrasture includes a central router, two switches, various desktp PCs, a laptop used by an engineer, and critical servers such as DHCP, DNS and an internal web server hosting company's resources.
#### The network devices are distributed across different departments and interconnected through multiple switches with all traffic routed through the central router.

## Key Objectives

#### . Design a secure internal network architecture to ensure productivity while protecting sensitive internal services.
#### . Implement network segmentation to minimize lateral movement in case of a breach. 
#### . Secure servers  (DHCP, DNS AND WEB ) to prevent unauthorized access and service disruption.
#### . Ensure robust routing and switching configuration for optimized network performance.
#### . Monitor and control network traffic through the central router for enhanced security and management.

## Tool Used 

#### . Packet Tracer: Utilized to simulate the entire network setup including routers, switches, servers, and end devices. 
####   This helps in visualizing the network architecture, testing configurations and identifying potenial vulnerabilities or misconfigurations before deploment.
